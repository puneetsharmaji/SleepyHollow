Note: Till project component 3, there were 4 people in the group: Puneet Sharma (G01352887), Samyuktha Harshini Padmanabhuni (G01356642), Hemant Kumar (G01357447) and Shrushti Gupta (G01394828). But for Project 4, the group has been divided. Since we are using the same database from previous component, We hope that it will not come under plagiarism.
